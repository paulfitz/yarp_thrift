This project is a way to compile Apache thrift with CMake.

How to use:
  mkdir build && ccmake ..
  # point THRIFT_ROOT to thrift source code
  make

If you are not familiar with CMake, try:
  mkdir thrift_me
  cd thrift_me
  svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/thrift/trunk thrift
  git clone https://github.com/paulfitz/thrift_cmake
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../thrift_cmake
  make
  ./tcc
